<h3> About Me</h3>

<p>I am <a id="nam" href="https://sites.math.unt.edu/~ntrang/" target="_blank">Nam Trang's</a> Ph.D. student studying combinatorial set theory, particularly, I study the combinatorics associated to generalizations of classical characteristics in determinacy models and canonical inner models. My primary interest are generalizations of independent families to uncountable cardinals and their existence (or non-existence) under determinacy-like hypotheses or in canonical models of determinacy.</p>


<h3> Invitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><span> I was invited to speak at the <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~goldberg/conference/index.html" target="_blank"> 2025 Berkeley Inner Model Theory Conference</a></span></li>
<li><span> I was invited to participate in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/impan.pl/simsem-godelprogram/overview?authuser=7" target="_blank">Simons Semester</a>, a five week program at IMPAN in Będlewo and Warsaw in the spring of 2026 </span></li>
</ul>

<h3> Awards and Funding </h3>
<ul>
<li><span>I was awarded an <a href="https://www.marshallplan.at" target="_blank">Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation</a> fellowhip to study at the TU Wien under the supervision of <a href="https://dmg.tuwien.ac.at/sandramueller/" target="_blank">Sandra Müller</a> in the fall of 2026. You can find the project description <a href="projdesc.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  </span></li>
<li><span>The Simons Semester is funded by the Simon's Foundation. The foundation provided funding for eleven advanced graduate students or recent Ph.D. recipients and I was selected by the organizers to recieve funding.</span></li> 
<li><span> I was awarded the Dan Mauldin Scholarship in the first year of my Ph.D. studies, a scholarship to support new Ph.D. students studying logic at UNT. </span></li>
<li><span>My undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan (2018-2022) was funded by the Basting's Scholarship.</span></li>
